      <h3>Favorite Episode: Season 3 Episode 7</h3>
      <p>Andre (Marcus Henderson) woke up around 11 a.m. only to see his daughter never came home from the party the night before. He called his cop friends over for help, and they received a call that they found his car. His vehicle was found in a bad side of town, completely dismantled.He then asked around if anyone had seen her, before walking in Franklin’s house and asking for his assistance. Franklin picked his best friend, Leon, up, and they started with their bodyguard, Fatback (Jordan Coleman).The young kid who wants to work for Leon overheard and said he saw her in a car with Wanda around 7:30 that morning. After everything that happened with Wanda, Leon is sure that they’re out doing crack together.</p>
      <p>Wanda invited Mel to smoke “until they came back,” and then they went to Mel’s job at the bowling alley for drinks. They continued to smoke there until the high, and the crack supply ran out. Wanda then punched and kicked Mel in the face to steal her necklace.Immediately, she went back to the crack house attempting to sell the jewelry, before Mel showed up and took her necklace back. Mel then went to a different place to get high, where Franklin eventually found her.Franklin had to drag her out of the house, kicking and screaming. He realized Leon was right about how crack does take over people. Franklin dropped Mel off at her house and refused to tell her dad where he found her. Instead, he only warned Andre to never let Mel out of his sight again.</p>
